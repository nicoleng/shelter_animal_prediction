# Predicting Animal Shelter Outcomes

The goal of this project is to predict the outcome of shelter animals given a dataset containing intake information including breed, color, sex and age. This is a [past Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes) with data from [Austin Animal Center](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/animal-services) from October 1st, 2013 to March, 2016. 

There are 5 possible outcomes for animals leaving the Animal Center: Adoption, Died, Euthanasia, Return to owner, and Transfer. I hope these insights will shed light on trends and opportunities to help more animals find a loving home.
